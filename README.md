**Unveiling the Power of Data: JS Mart Sales Analysis with Power BI**

I am excited to share the project on JS Mart sales analysis, where I've created an interactive dashboard using MS Power BI. The analysis includes sales data from the years 2017 to 2020, providing valuable insights into JS Mart's performance over this period.


JS martâ€™s sales data includes 2 tables .the first table(list of orders)contains the details of all the order ids , order dates , region , customer name , shipment date and mode. The second table contains a more details break down of orders like product name , sales , discount , profit , quantity of product ordered andcategory to which the product belongs.The sales data from the year 2017 -2020 is taken into consideration.


**Steps Involved in Creating the Interactive Dashboard for JS Mart:**

#Objective:#

Before diving into the dashboard, it is crucial to set a clear objective. In this analysis, I aimed to:


Analyze sales based on various regions and countries to identify the highest contributors.

Examine sales performance over a three-year period from 2017 to 2020.

Determine which regions accounted for a large number of orders.

Identify the segment (consumer, home office, corporate) with the highest sales contribution.

#Data Loading:#

The first step was loading the data from an Excel source into Power BI, ensuring a reliable foundation for the analysis.


#Data Visualization:#

To effectively present the sales data, I utilized various chart types, and strategically placed cards to highlight key values and KPIs, capturing the attention of end-users.


#Data Slicing and Drill-Through:#

To allow users to explore the data further, I implemented slicers for order dates and shipment dates, enabling data filtering based on specific time periods. Additionally, drill-through filters were set up to allow end-users to delve deeper into the data, especially when analyzing customer purchase habits.


#Presenting Key Insights:#

Through the use of buttons and bookmarks, I presented the key insights gained from the analysis:


The central region significantly contributed to the highest sales, accounting for 56% of total sales. Notably, countries like France (46.32% of total sales for the central region) and Germany (37.16% of total sales for the central region) were the primary drivers of sales within this region.

Over the three-year period, sales increased, and profit margins improved from 19.25% to an impressive 30.13%.

Approximately 54.3% of total orders originated from the central region, followed by the north region.

The consumer segment was the most substantial contributor to total sales, accounting for about 52.64%. Interestingly, the consumer segment's profit percentage increased over the three-year period, while the home-office segment experienced a 3% decline in profit.

#Conclusion:#

Based on the analysis, implementing the following key recommendations can strengthen JS Mart's market position:


Prioritize and invest in the central region, which contributed the highest sales. Identify key factors, such as successful marketing strategies and popular products, to implement in other regions as well.

Continuously monitor sales trends and profit margins to make data-driven decisions and optimize business strategies.
